# Video_Streaming_app
We are developing a video streaming web application where users can stream and watch educational courses online, each containing multiple videos. Built with Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and RESTful APIs, it uses MySQL/PostgreSQL for data management and React.js for the frontend, offering a smooth and engaging user experience.
